# Non-linear_manuscript

Supplementary files for "Non-linear regression modelling for medical professionals; making curved paths straight-forward"

This repository contains R scripts for performing the analyses, and outputting the 
plots and tables shown in the manuscript. The following files are available:

- **Case_study.R** is a simple R script which walks through the analyses and outputs
- **simulate_data.R** generates the simulated data. This is simply called by the other files and does not need to be opened
- **R_markdown_for_Supplementary_PDF.Rmd** contains the code from Case_study.R to allow a Supplementary PDF to be generated
- **R_markdown_for_Supplementary_PDF.pdf** the generated Supplementary PDF file
